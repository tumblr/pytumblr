# PyTumblr

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tumblr/pytumblr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tumblr/pytumblr)

## Create a client

A `pytumblr.TumblrRestClient` is the object you'll make all of your calls to the
Tumblr API through.  Creating one is this easy:

``` python
client = pytumblr.TumblrRestClient(
    '<consumer_key>',
    '<consumer_secret>',
    '<oauth_token>',
    '<oauth_secret>',
)

client.info() # Grabs the current user information
```

Two easy ways to get your credentials to are:

1.  The built-in `interactive_console.py` tool (if you already have a consumer key & secret)
2.  The Tumblr API console at https://api.tumblr.com/console

### Post Methods

#### Creating posts

PyTumblr lets you create all of the various types that Tumblr supports. When using
these types there are a few defaults that are able to be used with any post type. 

The default supported types are described below.

* **state**  - a string, the state of the post. Supported types are _published_, _draft_, _queue_, _private_
* **tags**   - a list, a list of strings that you want tagged on the post. eg: ["testing", "magic", "1"]
* **tweet**  - a string, the string of the customized tweet you want. eg: "Man I love my mega awesome post!"
* **date**   -  a string, the customized GMT that you want
* **format** - a string, the format that your post is in. Support types are _html_ or _markdown_
* **slug**   - a string, the slug for the url of the post you want

We'll show examples throughout of these default examples while showcasing all the specific post types.

Updating a post requires you knowing what type a post you're updating. You'll be able to supply to the post

Reblogging a post just requires knowing the post id and the reblog key, which is supplied in the JSON of any post object.

```

#### Deleting a post
Deleting just requires that you own the post and have the post id
```python
client.delete_post("codingjester", 123456) # Deletes your post :(
```

A note on tags: When passing tags, as params, please pass them as a list (not
a comma-separated string):

``` python
client.create_text('seejohnrun', tags=['hello', 'world'], ...)
```

### Tagged Methods

```python
client.tagged(tag, **params); # get posts with a given tag
```

## Using the interactive console

This client comes with a nice interactive console to run you through the OAuth
process, grab your tokens (and store them for future use).

You'll need `pyyaml` installed to run it, but then it's just:

``` bash
$ python interactive-console.py
```

and away you go!  Tokens are stored in `~/.tumblr` and are also shared by other
Tumblr API clients like the Ruby client.

## Running tests

The tests (and coverage reports) are run with nose, like this:

``` bash
python setup.py test
```
