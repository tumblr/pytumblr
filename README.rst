Installation
============

Install via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pytumblr

Usage
=====

Create a client
---------------

A ``pytumblr.TumblrRestClient`` is the object you'll make all of your calls to the Tumblr API through. Creating one is this easy:

.. code:: python

    client = pytumblr.TumblrRestClient(
        '<consumer_key>',
        '<consumer_secret>',
        '<oauth_token>',
        '<oauth_secret>',
    )

    client.info() # Grabs the current user information

Two easy ways to get your credentials to are:

1. The built-in ``interactive_console.py`` tool (if you already have a consumer key & secret)
2. The Tumblr API console at https://api.tumblr.com/console
3. Get sample login code at https://api.tumblr.com/console/calls/user/info

The default supported types are described below.

-  **tags** - a list, a list of strings that you want tagged on the post. eg: ["testing", "magic", "1"]

Deleting a post

Deleting just requires that you own the post and have the post id

.. code:: python

    client.delete_post(blogName, 123456) # Deletes your post :(

A note on tags: When passing tags, as params, please pass them as a list (not a comma-separated string):

.. code:: python

Getting notes for a post

In order to get the notes for a post, you need to have the post id and the blog that it is on.

.. code:: python

    data = client.notes(blogName, id='123456')

The results include a timestamp you can use to make future calls.

.. code:: python

    data = client.notes(blogName, id='123456', before_timestamp=data["_links"]["next"]["query_params"]["before_timestamp"])


Tagged Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    # get posts with a given tag
    client.tagged(tag, **params)

Using the interactive console
-----------------------------

This client comes with a nice interactive console to run you through the OAuth process, grab your tokens (and store them for future use).

You'll need ``pyyaml`` installed to run it, but then it's just:

.. code:: bash

    $ python interactive-console.py

and away you go! Tokens are stored in ``~/.tumblr`` and are also shared by other Tumblr API clients like the Ruby client.

Running tests
-------------

The tests (and coverage reports) are run with nose, like this:

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py test
